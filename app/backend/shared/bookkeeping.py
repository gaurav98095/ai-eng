"""Deciding when a file, and then a session, is finished.

This lived inside the ingest worker until the GPU started reporting its own
results. Now two different processes need it — the worker, when a document
fails early, and the broker, when the GPU says a job is done — so it lives
here and both import it.

Everything here is synchronous. The broker is an async endpoint and calls it
through `run_in_threadpool`, which is the same discipline the rest of the API
follows for anything that blocks.

    Counted, not incremented. An increment looks simpler and is wrong here:
    this can run on the failure path, immediately before a message goes back to
    the queue to be retried. A counter would then be bumped once per *attempt*
    rather than once per file, and with five attempts a one-file session would
    end up claiming six were done.

    Deriving the number from the files themselves is idempotent by
    construction, which is what at-least-once delivery requires.

    A file that failed and is about to be retried counts as settled for now, so
    a session can close as `failed` and then reopen as `ready` when the retry
    succeeds. That flap is deliberate: the alternative is a session that never
    closes at all while a doomed file exhausts its attempts.
