"""Redis: the conversation window, and the channel that carries progress.

Two jobs, and the second is what makes streaming possible across a fleet.

**The conversation window.** Version 1 kept the last few turns in a Python
dictionary, which worked because there was one process. With many API tasks and
many workers, a user's history has to live somewhere all of them can see.

**Pub/sub.** A worker generates an answer, but the browser's connection is held
by some API task, and they are not the same process and never will be. The
worker publishes to a channel named for the session; whichever API task holds
that connection is subscribed and relays what arrives. Without this, streaming
only works when you have exactly one API instance — which is to say, it does
not work.

The API side is async (it holds these connections on the event loop); the
worker side is synchronous. Hence two clients over one server.
