"""The consume loop both workers share.

Long-poll the queue, hand each message to a handler, delete it if the handler
succeeds, and leave it alone if it does not — an untouched message becomes
visible again when its timeout expires and someone else tries it. After enough
failures SQS moves it to the dead-letter queue by itself.

Two details that matter more than they look:

**A heartbeat.** A job that takes longer than the visibility timeout would be
handed to a second worker while the first is still working on it. So the
handler is run on a thread and the main loop extends the message's visibility
while it is going.

**Graceful shutdown.** A container gets SIGTERM and then, some seconds later,
SIGKILL. We stop pulling new work immediately and let the message in progress
finish, so a deploy does not create a duplicate of every in-flight job.
