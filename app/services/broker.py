"""Pulling work from the broker, instead of waiting to be called.

Read this file before the two handlers that use it. It is the whole of the GPU
side of the pattern, and it is deliberately small.

The old way, and why it hurt
----------------------------
The backend used to call us: `POST /transcribe`, and then hold that connection
open for however long a twenty-minute video takes. Everything about that is
fragile. The connection has to survive the whole job. We need a public address
for the backend to reach, which on Colab means a tunnel whose hostname changes
every restart. If we crash half way, the work is simply gone — nobody wrote
down that it was ever started. And if fifty videos arrive at once, we get fifty
simultaneous connections rather than a queue.

The new way
-----------
We ask *them* for work.

    claim      "anything to do?"    -> a job, or nothing
    heartbeat  "still going"        -> sent while we work
    complete   "done" / "failed"    -> the outcome

Three things fall out of turning the arrow around, and they are the reason the
pattern exists:

**No credentials.** We never talk to AWS. The backend holds the keys and talks
to the queue on our behalf. We hold one token that lets us ask for a job and
nothing else — it cannot read a bucket, list a queue, or touch another
session's data. If it leaks, one line of the backend's `.env` revokes it.

**No inbound address.** Every connection starts here and goes out. Colab
allows that freely, and it means this half of the system needs no tunnel at
all — no ephemeral hostname, nothing to paste into a screen, no
hundred-second proxy limit.

**Nothing is lost.** A job is not acknowledged until we say it finished. If
this runtime dies mid-transcription, the job becomes visible again and is
handed out afresh. Compare that with an HTTP call, where a dropped connection
takes the work with it.

How we touch storage without credentials
----------------------------------------
Each job arrives with **presigned URLs** already in it: a link to read the
input, and where it applies, a link to write the output. A presigned URL is a
normal https address with a signature attached that says "whoever holds this
may do this one thing to this one object until this time." So we use plain
`requests.get` and `requests.put` and never learn a bucket name.
